bugs:
- doesn't seem to be any field in the class for "cycle_running"
- Same case for port_lock

Design: 
- Too many methods for speed manipulation. One works just fine for increase/decrease.
- For max speed method, instead of calculating it every time we could specify a field 
  for the maximum speed and potentially update it every time a new speed is recorded.
  This way it would take O(1) time as opposed to O(N) right now.
- Same for Avg speeds
